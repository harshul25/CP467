# CP467
Image Processing

Assignment #1


This assignment is for edge detection. We import an image, gray scale it and use the following matrix 

{ [-1,-1,-1],
  [-1,8,-1],
  [-1,-1,-1] }
  
This matrix is then convoluted with the original image and we are able to detect the edges.The method of
convolution is the same as the option #1 which was taught in class in which we iterate pixel by pixel and
multiply the kernel/filter with the pixels in the image
